                    <dt><strong>Red Wine:</strong> </dt>
                   <dd>The red-wine production process involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin. Red wine is made from dark-colored grape varieties. The actual color of the wine can range from violet, typical of young wines, through red for mature wines, to brown for older red wines.</dd>
                   <p></p>
                   <dt><strong>White Wine:</strong> </dt>
                   <dd>Fermentation of the non-colored grape pulp produces white wine. The grapes from which white wine is produced are typically green or yellow. Some varieties are well-known, such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon, and Riesling. Other white wines are blended from multiple varieties; Tokay, Sherry, and Sauternes are examples of these.</dd>
                   <p></p>
                    <dt><strong>Rose Wine:</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A ros√© wine incorporates some of the color from the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The pink color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals used and wine-making techniques.</dd>
